        into the radio’s ‘settings’ menu then select ‘UPnP’ then ‘Device Name’.  After changing your radio’s name 
        please restart your radio and this app.\n\n

        service packs starting with ‘V25’ please use the original Grace iPhone app.  To check your service pack on 
        your radio select ‘settings’ then select ‘version’ or ‘properties’.\n\n
