Grace Digital Remote Control app for Android.

A mobile application for controlling Grace Digital Internet Radios.<br>  https://gracedigtial.com/product-category/internet-radios/

The app was first developed in early 2012 and released in the spring of 2012.  The last privately developed build was released on the Google store at the end of 2014.  As the Android market has expanded it has become a larger challenge to meet on an ongoing, consistent basis.  Our goal in opening up the code is simply to empower the user community.  We hope more developers will get involved to update the application and continue to add enhancements going forward.
