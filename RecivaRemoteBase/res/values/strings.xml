    <string name="GraceFAQ">• Do you have multiple Grace Internet radios? Change the name of any radio by entering  
        into the radio’s ‘settings’ menu then select ‘UPnP’ then ‘Device Name’.  After changing your radio’s name 
        please restart your radio and this app.\n\n
        • This app is optimized for Grace Internet radios with service packs starting with ‘V26’. Radios with 
        service packs starting with ‘V25’ please use the original Grace iPhone app.  To check your service pack on 
        your radio select ‘settings’ then select ‘version’ or ‘properties’.\n\n
        • No Radios Found: Make sure your phone uses the same Wi-Fi network as your Grace Internet radio(s)\n\n
